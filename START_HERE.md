## 💡 TIPS

### For Best Results:

1. **Good Photos** - Clear, well-lit, front-facing
2. **Consistent Lighting** - Train and recognize in similar lighting
3. **One Face Per Image** - No group photos
4. **Test First** - Start with 2-3 students before full rollout
5. **Daily Backup** - Copy `attendance.csv` daily

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ Using logo images instead of face photos
❌ Using group photos (multiple faces)
❌ Poor lighting or blurry photos
❌ Forgetting to delete sample images
❌ Not naming files properly

---

## 🎓 EXAMPLE USAGE

### First Day (Setup):
```bash
# 1. Collect all student photos
# 2. Name them: StudentName.jpg
# 3. Put in images/ folder
# 4. Double-click START_ATTENDANCE.bat
# 5. System trains (one time, 10-30 seconds)
# 6. Test with a few students
```

### Every Day After (Production):
```bash
# 1. Double-click START_ATTENDANCE.bat
# 2. Loads trained model (instant, 2 seconds)
# 3. Camera opens
# 4. Students line up and look at camera
# 5. Automatic marking
# 6. Press 'Q' when done
# 7. Export attendance.csv
```
