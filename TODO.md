# TODO: Fix face_recognition undefined errors in simple_face_recognition.py

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Update requirements.txt to include face-recognition library
- [x] Refactor simple_face_recognition.py to use face_recognition instead of OpenCV LBPH
  - [x] Add import face_recognition
  - [x] Update FaceRecognitionAttendance class to use face_recognition
  - [x] Modify load_known_faces method to use face_recognition.face_encodings
  - [x] Update save_encodings and load_encodings to handle face_recognition encodings
  - [x] Modify start_recognition to use face_recognition for real-time recognition
- [x] Install updated requirements
- [x] Test the refactored code for errors

## Additional Tasks:
- [x] Create DeepFace-based face recognition system (deepface_face_recognition.py)
- [x] Install DeepFace dependencies (deepface, tf-keras)
- [x] Fix PermissionError in temp file cleanup
- [x] Test DeepFace system with sample images
